Merge By n-Way Diff
===================

Prototype for testing product line adoption by merging. Requires the SAVE tool to generate diff reports.

The remaining infrastructure here and scripts should work when `git` and `sbt` are installed. The frontend, which includes TypeChef, is implemented in the mergebyname folder and can be compiled with sbt: `sbt mkrun` (that command gets Scala and the required libraries and produces a `run.sh` shell script).


Good luck.
